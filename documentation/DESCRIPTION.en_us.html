<h2>Prehistory</h2>
<p>
    An <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-new-teletext-character-set-with-enhanced-Nes/a632eb8fbe9f4e23d09b8108d211b403da9e36c1">initial version of the original font</a> was demonstrated by Floris V. van Nes in August 1986, called IPO-Normal. This font made it possible to improve the legibility of messages transmitted through TV information services such as teletext, since the resolution of the TV signal was limited to save bandwidth on television channels.

In November of the same year, Philips Semiconductors (NXP) introduced one of the first video processors with teletext support, the SAA5231. And 4.5 years later, it introduced the SAA5243 teletext decoder, which used external modifications of the IPO-Normal font. Later, separate versions of video processors were released without teletext decoding, but with teletext-style character generation, such as the SAA5541.
